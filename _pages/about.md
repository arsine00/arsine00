# About me

My name is **Kihyun Kim**, and I am currently an undergraduate student in the **Department of Chemical Engineering at POSTECH**, conducting research in the [Synthetic Biology Lab](https://sbl.postech.ac.kr/sblmanager/index.do) under the supervision of [Prof. Jeong Wook Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Mu7NXDwAAAAJ&hl=en). I am expected to graduate with a **B.S. in Chemical Engineering in February 2026**. Starting in **April 2026**, I will join [Prof. Tsutomu Suzuki](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sx1JKE8AAAAJ&hl=ja)’s [laboratory at the University of Tokyo](https://rna.chem.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) as a recipient of the **MEXT scholarship**.  

My research interests lie in **tRNA modification mechanisms, their roles in disease, and potential therapeutic approaches**. I place strong emphasis on **rigorous troubleshooting and experimental quality control** in my work.  

From **May 2022 to February 2024**, I served in the **Republic of Korea Air Force as a chemical specialist**, after which I studied for one year as an **exchange student at the University of Tokyo**. I am fluent in **Korean, English, and Japanese**, and I enjoy learning languages from diverse cultures.
